# Regression test for xfsprogs commit:
#
# XXXXXXXX ("xfs_copy: don't use cached buffer reads until after libxfs_mount")
#
# It was discovered that passing xfs_copy a source device containing an ext4
# filesystem would cause xfs_copy to crash.  Further investigation revealed
# that any readable path that didn't have a plausible XFS superblock in block
# zero would produce the same crash, so this regression test exploits that.
