# FS QA Test 280
#
# Test that if we have a large file, with file extent items spanning several
# leaves in the fs tree, and that is shared due to a snapshot, if we COW one of
# the extents, doing a fiemap will report the respective file range as not
# shared.
#
# This exercises the processing of delayed references for metadata extents in
# the backref walking code, used by fiemap to determine if an extent is shared.

# A 128M file full of compressed extents results in a fs tree with a heigth

# While writing the file it's possible, but rare, that writeback kicked in due
# to memory pressure or a concurrent sync call for example, so we may end up
# with extents smaller than 128K (the maximum size for compressed extents) and
# therefore make the test expectations fail because we get more extents than
# what the golden output expects. So run defrag to make sure we get exactly
# the expected number of 128K extents (1024 extents).
