# Verify the on-disk format of encrypted files that use a crypto data unit size
# that differs from the filesystem block size.  This tests the functionality
# that was introduced in Linux 6.7 by kernel commit 5b1188847180
# ("fscrypt: support crypto data unit size less than filesystem block size").

	"fscrypt: support crypto data unit size less than filesystem block size"

# For now, just test 512-byte and 1024-byte data units.  Filesystems accept
# power-of-2 sizes between 512 and the filesystem block size, inclusively.
# Testing 512 and 1024 ensures this test will run for any FS block size >= 1024
# (provided that the filesystem supports sub-block data units at all).
